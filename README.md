# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

The AirBnB clone sums up the implementation of my four months of studies at ALX - software engineering program.
The goal of the project is to deploy a replica of the Airbnb Website using my server. The final version of this project will have:

* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like a shell (for development and debugging)
* A website (front-end) with static and dynamic functionalities
* A comprehensive database to manage the backend functionalities
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front and backend of the system.

## Description of the command interpreter

| __Command | __Description |
| --- | --- |
| `exit` | exits the console |
| `ctrl+D` | exits the console |
| `help` | Displays all commands |
| `create <class>` | Creates an object of types, saves it to a JSON file, and prints the object ID |
